# Deepfake-Media-Detection-for-secure-digital-communication-using-Deep-Learning

The deepfake detection system leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to identify synthetically generated audio-visual content. The exponential rise of deepfake technology poses significant threats to digital trust and security across critical domains like banking, law enforcement, and media. This solution is designed to combat these threats by verifying the authenticity of media in real-time.

The system analyzes both video and audio signals, focusing on subtle inconsistencies in facial expressions and synchronization, and is deployed via a Flask-based web application for practical, user-friendly interaction.

Key Features
- Deep Neural Network (DNN) Classifier: A robust DNN architecture with ReLU activation, dropout layers, and Softmax output for binary prediction ("Real" or "Fake").

- Frame-by-Frame Feature Extraction: Utilizes OpenCV and Haar cascades to detect and extract faces from video frames before classification.

- Real-time Web Deployment: A Flask application enables users to upload videos instant deepfake analysis.

- Confidence Scoring: Provides a confidence score alongside the "Real" or "Fake" label to aid user interpretation.

- High Performance: The model was trained and evaluated on the FakeAVCeleb dataset. Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves) confirmed excellent detection performance, with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.92

Proposed Methodology
- The detection process follows a structured pipeline:

- Input: An MP4 video file is uploaded.

- Frame Extraction: The video is split into individual frames using OpenCV.

- Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

- Face Detection: Haar cascade classifiers locate facial regions in each frame.

- The detected faces are cropped, resized, and normalized.

- The audio track is also separated for analysis of speech patterns.

- Features are extracted from both video and audio (e.g., facial landmarks, pitch).

- Model Inference: Extracted features are fed into the trained DNN model.

- Output: The model generates a "Real/Fake Prediction" with a corresponding "Confidence Score".

Results
The DNN model demonstrated strong reliability in identifying deepfakes, with testing showing over 

90% accuracy and a high F1-score. The confusion matrix also confirmed a low number of false positives and negatives.

ROC AUC: 0.92


Future Enhancements
Future development will focus on the following areas :

- Handling Compressed Video: Expanding the system to handle mobile-compressed formats and improving robustness across varied data sources.

- Multi-modal Analysis: Further integrating both audio and visual features to enhance detection accuracy.

- Deployment Optimization: Optimizing the model for deployment on mobile and edge devices.

- User Interface: Developing a more responsive and user-friendly front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Continuous Learning: Implementing mechanisms to allow the model to adapt to new and evolving deepfake generation techniques.
